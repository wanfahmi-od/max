      <audio_text>The main difference to the MAX landing gear system is that the LANDING GEAR lever only has two positions; Up or Down. The OFF position has been removed. This is due to the LANDING GEAR lever electrically controlling the hydraulic extend and retract system, as opposed to mechanical connections on the NG. In the NG, hydraulic pressure is removed by placing the LANDING GEAR lever in the OFF position.</audio_text>

      <audio_text>In the MAX, pressure is removed from the system 10 seconds after all landing gear are up and locked. Note: After the Gear Lever is moved to the UP position following takeoff or go around, do not attempt to move the gear lever. Doing so may inadvertently extend the Landing Gear.</audio_text>
