      <audio_text>The engine starter limitations are changed for the LEAP-1B. For the normal starter duty cycle, multiple start attempts are allowed similar to the CFM 56; however, each normal start attempt is limited to 3 minutes on the MAX, compared to 2 minutes on the NG. Starter usage is limited to 5 minutes for all extended engine motorings. A minimum of 5 minutes is needed between the first two extended engine motorings. For the third and subsequent extended engine motorings, a minimum of 10 minutes is needed between each engine extended motoring. The recommended engine warm up time before takeoff for the LEAP-1B is 3 minutes with an oil temperature of 31° celsius, as opposed to 2 minutes on the CFM 56.</audio_text>
