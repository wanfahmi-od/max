      <audio_text>When starting the engine, the EEC will initially maintain an N2 between 18% and 24.0% depending on certain conditions. The time spent motoring is called Bowed Rotor Motoring (BRM). BRM is designed to straighten the rotor shaft which will naturally “bow” due to thermal buildup after the engine is shutdown. BRM timing is variable, depending on several factors such as time since engine shutdown, internal engine temperature, ambient temperature, etc. BRM will be active for approximately 6-90 seconds and is only active for engine starts on the ground.</audio_text>
