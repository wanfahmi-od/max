      <audio_text>The FCC uses a corrected AOA value to activate the MCAS function. This logic uses both AOA vanes and filters out small differences between the vanes and provides a single corrected value to the Speed Trim System. This provides additional signal processing to protect against an erroneous AOA.</audio_text>
