      <audio_text>Compared to the 737NG, the 737 MAX has a larger diameter engine which is located farther forward on the wing. This contributed to minor changes in aerodynamic pitch characteristics at high angles of attack with Flaps UP. This resulted in control column forces that did not consistently increase as a function of angle of attack.</audio_text>
